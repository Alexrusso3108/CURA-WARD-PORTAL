# âœ… Automatic Bed Count Updates

## Feature Overview

The system now **automatically updates ward bed counts** when patients are admitted, transferred, discharged, or deleted. This ensures the dashboard and ward management pages always show accurate, real-time bed availability.

## How It Works

### 1. **When a Patient is Admitted** (Add Patient)
- âœ… Patient is added to `ward_patients` table
- âœ… Ward's `occupied_beds` increases by 1
- âœ… Ward's `available_beds` decreases by 1
- âœ… Dashboard and Ward Management pages update automatically

### 2. **When a Patient is Transferred** (Change Ward)
- âœ… Old ward's `occupied_beds` decreases by 1
- âœ… Old ward's `available_beds` increases by 1
- âœ… New ward's `occupied_beds` increases by 1
- âœ… New ward's `available_beds` decreases by 1
- âœ… Both wards update in real-time

### 3. **When a Patient is Discharged**
- âœ… Patient status changes to "Discharged"
- âœ… Ward's `occupied_beds` decreases by 1
- âœ… Ward's `available_beds` increases by 1
- âœ… Bed becomes available for new patients

### 4. **When a Patient Record is Deleted**
- âœ… Patient removed from database
- âœ… Ward's `occupied_beds` decreases by 1 (if patient was admitted)
- âœ… Ward's `available_beds` increases by 1
- âœ… Bed count restored

## Implementation Details

### Helper Function: `updateWardBedCount(wardId, increment)`
```javascript
// Automatically updates ward bed counts
// increment = true: Adds a patient (increases occupied, decreases available)
// increment = false: Removes a patient (decreases occupied, increases available)
```

### Patient Operations Updated

1. **addPatient()**
   - Adds patient to database
   - If status is not "Discharged", increases ward's occupied beds

2. **updatePatient()**
   - Checks if ward changed
   - Decreases old ward's occupied beds
   - Increases new ward's occupied beds
   - Handles status changes

3. **deletePatient()**
   - Gets patient's ward before deletion
   - Decreases ward's occupied beds
   - Removes patient from database

4. **dischargePatient()**
   - Updates patient status to "Discharged"
   - Decreases ward's occupied beds
   - Frees up the bed

## Dashboard Updates

The dashboard automatically reflects these changes:

### Total Wards Card
- Shows total number of wards
- Shows total beds across all wards

### Available Beds Card
- Shows sum of all available beds
- Updates in real-time as patients are admitted/discharged
- Shows occupancy percentage

### Ward Occupancy Chart
- Bar chart showing occupied vs available beds per ward
- Updates automatically when bed counts change

## Ward Management Updates

Each ward card shows:
- **Bed Occupancy**: X occupied / Y total beds
- **Occupancy Rate**: Percentage (e.g., 75%)
- **Available Beds**: Calculated as total - occupied

All values update automatically when:
- New patient is admitted
- Patient is transferred to another ward
- Patient is discharged
- Patient record is deleted

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admit New Patient
```
Before:
- ICU Ward: 8 occupied / 10 total (2 available)

Action: Add patient to ICU Ward

After:
- ICU Ward: 9 occupied / 10 total (1 available)
- Dashboard "Available Beds" decreases by 1
```

### Scenario 2: Transfer Patient
```
Before:
- ICU Ward: 9 occupied / 10 total (1 available)
- General Ward: 15 occupied / 20 total (5 available)

Action: Transfer patient from ICU to General Ward

After:
- ICU Ward: 8 occupied / 10 total (2 available)
- General Ward: 16 occupied / 20 total (4 available)
```

### Scenario 3: Discharge Patient
```
Before:
- ICU Ward: 9 occupied / 10 total (1 available)

Action: Discharge patient from ICU Ward

After:
- ICU Ward: 8 occupied / 10 total (2 available)
- Dashboard "Available Beds" increases by 1
- Patient status shows "Discharged"
```

## Benefits

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. **Add a patient** to a ward
   - Check ward card shows increased occupied beds
   - Check dashboard shows decreased available beds

2. **Transfer a patient** to another ward
   - Check both wards update correctly
   - Verify old ward gains a bed
   - Verify new ward loses a bed

3. **Discharge a patient**
   - Check ward shows decreased occupied beds
   - Check dashboard shows increased available beds

4. **Delete a patient**
   - Check ward bed count restores
   - Verify dashboard updates

All updates happen automatically - no page refresh needed! ðŸŽ‰
