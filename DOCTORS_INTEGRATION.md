# âœ… Doctors Integration Complete

## What Was Done

I've integrated your existing `doctors` table with the patient form. Now when adding a patient, the **Attending Doctor** field is a dropdown that shows all doctors from your database.

## Changes Made

### 1. AppContext.jsx
- âœ… Added `doctors` state
- âœ… Added `fetchDoctors()` function to fetch from `doctors` table
- âœ… Doctors are fetched on app load
- âœ… Exported `doctors` in context value

### 2. Patients.jsx
- âœ… Added `doctors` to context
- âœ… Changed "Attending Doctor" from text input to dropdown
- âœ… Dropdown shows all doctors from database
- âœ… Doctors are sorted by name

## How It Works

1. **On App Load**: Fetches all doctors from `doctors` table
2. **In Patient Form**: Shows dropdown with all doctor names
3. **On Save**: Stores the selected doctor's name in `ward_patients.doctor` field

## What You'll See

When you click "Add Patient", the form will have:
- **Ward**: Dropdown showing all wards âœ…
- **Attending Doctor**: Dropdown showing all doctors âœ…

Both dropdowns are populated from your database!

## Database Structure Expected

The `doctors` table should have at least:
- `id` (UUID or any unique identifier)
- `name` (TEXT) - Doctor's name

The code will work with any additional columns in your doctors table.

## Testing

1. **Refresh your app** at http://localhost:3000
2. Go to **Patients** page
3. Click **"Add Patient"**
4. Check the **"Attending Doctor"** dropdown
5. You should see all doctors from your `doctors` table

## Next Steps

After creating the `ward_patients` table (run the SQL from `CREATE_WARD_PATIENTS_TABLE.md`), you'll be able to:
- âœ… Select ward from dropdown
- âœ… Select doctor from dropdown
- âœ… Fill in all other patient details
- âœ… Save patient to database

Everything is ready to go! ðŸŽ‰
